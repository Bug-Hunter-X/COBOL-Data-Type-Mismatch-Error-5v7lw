This repository contains a simple COBOL program that demonstrates a common data type mismatch error.  The program attempts to display an alphanumeric field ("WS-ALPHANUMERIC-FIELD") that is not suitable for numeric operations.  This can lead to unexpected results or program crashes, depending on the compiler and runtime environment. The solution shows how to correctly handle alphanumeric fields.
